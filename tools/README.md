# Development Tools

This directory is for offline artifact inspectors, trace converters, schema generators, and test-data utilities.

Tools must consume the shared protocol or stored evidence. They should not create a second instrumentation path that disagrees with the browser and broker.

Run `python3 tools/validate-evidence-store.py path/to/events.jsonl` to validate
normalized protocol v2 or v3 evidence, including runtime fingerprint operations
and artifact capture success or failure records. Validation checks record shape,
inline payload bounds, and sensitive HTTP metadata; it does not prove capture
completeness. Keep its category and event-type allowlists aligned with
[`include/reb/event.hpp`](../include/reb/event.hpp).
